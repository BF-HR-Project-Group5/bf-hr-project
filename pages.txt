Onboarding Application Page:
	(to view or fill out the application)
	(to view feedback on the application, if there is any feedback)

		if application is APPROVED:
				Redirect to "home page" (personal info page)
	
		else if NEVER SUBMITTED:
				show the form so they can fill out and submit the application

		else if (REJECTED || PENDING):
				show the submitted application
				view list of all uploaded documents from the user
					- can download documents
					- can preview documents in browser

				if REJECTED:
					- show the feedback from HR
					 			(ENTIRE APPLICATION feedback)
					- can make changes
					- can resubmit!

				if PENDING:
					- "Please wait for HR to review your application."
					- can NOT edit





Personal Information page:
	(to view and edit personal info, AKA the application info, once an application is APPROVED)

		sections of info: 
		Name
		Address
		ContactInfo
		Employment
		EmergencyContact
		Documents
				list of uploaded docs (license, work auth)
				can download
				can preview




Visa Status Management Page:
	(manage their work auth documents)

	if NOT chose OPT during onboarding application:
	OR if ALL documents  are ACCEPTED:
			"You're all set! Your documents have been approved."

	else, we need more documents:
	(They already uploaded the first document during Onboarding Application, so we need to wait for approval)
			Show a section:
					if thisDoc.status === PENDING: "Waiting for HR to approve your {this document}"
					if thisDoc.status === APPROVED: "Please upload your {next needed document}"
					if thisDoc.status === REJECTED: show the document's feedback

***
Could do this in a bunch of sections, and create a new section below when we need them to submit a new doc.
So at the start, only one section will be visible, but once it is approved, the next section will appear.
	i.e.
(first section, thisDocument = "OPT RECEIPT")

	"Please submit your {thisDocument}" || "Thanks for submitting your {thisDocument}"
	(PENDING | APPROVED | REJECTED: statusMessage from above)
	(if status === REJECTED, show feedback for {thisDocument})
	
(once previous section is APPROVED, show the next section: thisDocument = "OPT EAD")

	"Please submit your {thisDocument}" || "Thanks for submitting your {thisDocument}"
	(PENDING | APPROVED | REJECTED: statusMessage from above)
	(if status === REJECTED, show feedback for {thisDocument})

(once previous section is APPROVED, show the next section: thisDocument = "I-983 Form")

	...etc

	(View their housing details, NO EDITING)
	(Add a facility report)

		( Or build functionality into the Housing page )

		Create New Facility Report:
				show a form, fill it out, submit it and it appears below at the top of the list of Facility Reports
				To add a comment, click on it in the list below
				
		view your previous Facility reports, most recent at the top:
